# Optimal-Store-Locations
Finding optimal locations of new stores using Decision Optimization.
This notebook shows how Decision Optimization can help to prescribe decisions for a complex constrained problem using CPLEX Modeling for Python to help determine the optimal location for a new store. 
A fictional Coffee Company plans to open N shops in the near future and needs to determine where they should be located knowing the following:
Most of the customers of this coffee brewer enjoy reading and borrowing books, so the goal is to locate those shops in such a way that all the city public libraries are within minimal walking distance.
Chicago open data was used here.
K-Median model was implemented to get the optimal location of future shops.
